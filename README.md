# Repo Browser
Repo Browser is a different way of viewing GitHub repositories in your browser. Have you ever wanted to look at a specific file on Github? Have you ever wanted to browse a few different files across multiple folders? Probably not but I have! The goal is to give an experience that emulates that of vscode, but in your browser. No more cloning a repo then opening it up in your editor of choice just to browse a couple of files.

# How do I build this?
1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/ctcuff/repo-browser.git`
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn` in the root directory
3. Run `yarn dev` and visit localhost:9000 in your browser
